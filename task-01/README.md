Working on Bandit wargame was a completely new experience for me, especially using the linux terminal. This task helped me build the confidence to approach problems with a positive mindset . 
Along the way , I learned many new commands and gained experience operating a Linux system .Working on the git exercises was also a very good experience . The initial levels were simple and 
easy to follow , but as the levels increased ,the tasks became more challenging and time consuming .Learn git branching with visual representations also helped for the deep understanding.
It was a valuable learning journey.Overall , it was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience .
